## Introduction
PEACH method provides a versatile tool to analyze the cluster free energy and cluster size distribution based on cluster histograms generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. </br> 
For further background, please refer to the following literature.</br>
Zhang, X.;  Patel, L. A.;  Beckwith, O.;  Schneider, R.;  Weeden, C. J.; Kindt, J. T., Extracting Aggregation Free Energies of Mixed Clusters from Simulations of Small Systems: Application to Ionic Surfactant Micelles. Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2017, 13 (11), 5195-5206.</br>

## Input Files
- An input file is needed for running the analysis. Input file should include
    - A line indicating ($Total number of datasets,$Number of interation,$Alpha value,$Monomer concentration for output cluster free energy)
    - One or several datasets of cluster histograms with a line indicating ($Total number of surfactants, $Total number of counterions, $Number of lines,Volume) before the histogram.
- Sample input: input.txt (This is a collection of cluster histograms for sodium octyl sulfate.)

## Compile and run the f90 code
```
gfortran -O3 bipartite-multiset-FirstPass-vs006.f90 -o BPMS-FP.exe 
./BPMS-FP.exe < input.txt
```
## Output Files
- All output files have a prefix of "BPMS".
- You can read convergence criteria, cluster free energy and cluster size distribution from corresponding output files.

## Second Pass
- There are two ways that we consider to update the equilibrium constants throughout iterations. If you want to increase the accuracy of the cluster free energy, you should consider a second pass. 
  - The first pass used the relative weight of the standard deviation in the cluster frequency such that each entry to the geometric mean calculated from K_apparent is weighted relative to the data quality of that cluster sizes. For a cluster size i,
    ```
    NrelW(i)=Nstdv(i)/Navg(i)       (w(i)=1/NrelW(i))
    ```
  - The second pass used the relative weight based on the two standard deviations.
    ```
    KrelW(i)=NrelW(i)/(NrelW(1)**i) (w(i)=1/KrelW(i))
    ```
- For the second pass, the input includes   
    - One line indicating ($Total number of datasets,$Number of interation,$Alpha value,$Monomer concentration for output cluster free energy)
    - One line indicating $Total number of lines of K
    - A table of cluster size and corresponding equilibrium constants K
    - The above concatanates the input file of cluster histograms from the first pass
- Sample input: input-SP.txt
- The f90 code is compiled in the same way.
- Same output files are generated.
